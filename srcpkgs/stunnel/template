# REMARKS:
# What. A. Pain. What a total pain.
# Using the archive is the only way to get builds to keep working after the
# new version is out.  LibreSSL patches for stunnel 5.35 don't yet work. Not
# enough is made conditional.
# Significant thanks to the OpenBSD project for creating patch sets for 5.37
# One thing OpenBSD does that we don't do here is add a _stunnel user/group and
# modify the configuration samples to chroot and use this by default.
