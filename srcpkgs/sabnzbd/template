	# sabnzbd bundles a heavily modified version of cherrypy. It's
	# uncertain what base version they use, or where each individual
	# patch came from, so using upstream cherrypy isn't an option.

	# sabnzbd also bundles a variety of small libraries, some of which
	# haven't been maintained since 2006. There may be no point to
	# packaging them separately.
